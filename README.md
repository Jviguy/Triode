# Triode
A ternary computer emulator. This is very far from being complete.

## Goals for now
- [ ] Basic instruction for emulated CPU.
- [ ] Basic Assembler
- [ ] Fully flushed out instruction set.
- [ ] Upgrade Assembler to use those.
- [ ] Potentially a Rust / C target for this architecture Very complex probably not.
- [ ] End goal is write a simple operating system with this, either in the asm or Rust / C.

## Previous work
From the original C++ repository I had the first goal finished and manually was writing byte code in a weird compression format.
Im going to try to get to that state again and then see what happens from there.
